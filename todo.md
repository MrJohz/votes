# Things yet to be done:

- Title, words need to be checked and played with
    + Frontpage (need a call to action, clear message - custom formatting?)
    + About page (need text, anything at all)
    + Footer (need text)
    + Individual systems (need more detail)
- Better algorithm (perhaps include checkbox for emphasising importance?) (need to rewrite questions first)
- Facebook OG tags for sharing
- Share functionality
- rewrite CSS
    + Accessibility, cross-browser compat
    + Modularise more stuff, perhaps use compass/etc for grid?
- create_static_files command for cl interface
