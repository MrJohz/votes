        First-past-the-post is perhaps the simplest voting system.  Voters choose their
        favourite candidate, and, when the votes are counted, the candidate with the most
        number of votes wins.  In the UK, this system is used to vote for individual
        members of parliament in each constituency.  The party that gains more than 50% of
        the constituencies then becomes the government.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important aspects to first-past-the-post is the ability to elect
        a local member of parliament.  First-past-the-post isn't the only voting system
        that elects constituency representatives, but it is one of the simplest ways to
        implement it.  This makes elections fairly simple to understand and take part in,
        lowering the barrier of entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, first-past-the-post has a tendency to create uneven parliaments that do
        not necessarily represent the country as a whole.  For example, in the 2015
        elections, the winning party only recieved 40% of the popular vote.  Additionally,
        first-past-the-post tends to heavily favour the biggest parties nationally,
        meaning that smaller parties often can't get any seats at all, no matter how much
        support they have across the country.  This can often lead to tactical voting,
        where a supporter of a smaller party will vote for a larger party because they
        know the smaller party won't win, but the larger party is more likely to have a
        chance at winning.

  av:
    name: Alternative Vote
    information:
      - Used in Labour and Lib Dem leadership elections
      - A modification of FPTP that tries to remove tactical voting
      - Allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference
      - Britain rejected this system in a referendum in 2011

      <p>
        The alternative vote, also known as instant-runoff voting, is a voting system very
        similar to first-past-the-post, but designed to eliminate some of the need for
        tactical voting.  Instead of just picking one candidate, the voter ranks the
        different candidates in order.  When the votes for a constituency are counted, if
        no candidate got 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the lowest number of
        votes is eliminated, and the second preference for each of their votes is counted.
        Generally, this happens until one candidate reaches 50% of the vote, although there
        are other systems that have a fixed number of recounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This system allows people who want to vote for a smaller party to do so, while still
        ensuring that their vote isn't wasted, as they can still transfer it to a larger
        party that has a better chance of winning.  However, it still keeps the constituency
        representative, making it almost a drop-in replacement for first-past-the-post.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alternative vote is more complicated than first-past-the-post, and may require
        multiple recounts, meaning that counting the votes becomes a lot slower, and may
        require the introduction of electronic machines.  It also still leads to results
        that do not represent the country nationally, and often does not lead to the
        election of smaller parties, but can increase the lead of the larger parties.

  borda:
    name: Borda Count
    information:
      - Rank each candidate and give each candidate points based on their rank
      - Used in many competitions such as Eurovision and many American sports awards
      - Elects a single candidate in each constituency
    description: >
      <p>
        In the Borda count election, voters rank as many candidates as they wish in order
        of preference.  The candidate ranked first is given as many points as there are
        candidates, then candidate ranked second is given one fewer points, and so on,
        with the candidate ranked last (and all unranked candidates) given one point.
        For example, in an election with five candidates, a voter's highest-ranked
        candidate would get five points, then four points, then three points, and so on.
        These point scores are then added up across all the voters in the constituency,
        and the winner is the candidate with the highest number of points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Borda count does not always elect the candidate that is prefered by the
        majority of voters.  This is because it gives more weight to lower preferences
        than in other systems.  For example, where an absolute (say, 51%) majority of
        people support a single candidate, but every other voter puts that candidate in
        a low position, then the Borda count may not elect that controversial candidate,
        but instead will choose a candidate that very few people chose as their first
        choice, but generally came fairly highly in a number of rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
        One major issue with the Borda count is that it is very susceptible to tactical
        voting.  For example, in an election between four candidates, (A, B, C, and D)
        most people would rank all of the candidates in order of preference.  For
        example, most supporters of candidate A might generally have the preference
        "A, C, D, B".  However, if polls suggested that the election was a close run
        between candidates C and D, voters who supported A but preferred C to D might
        choose to "sacrifice" their own candidate A in favour of C, and bury D below B,
        even though this goes against their normal preference.  This would give C the
        biggest chance, but is a strong form of tactical voting - supporters of A cannot
        express their true preference, because this would allow an unwanted candidate to
        win.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to criticism of the Borda count due to this tactical manipulation,
        the original creator (M. de Borda) supposedly stated "My scheme is intended for
        only honest men".

  block-vote:
    name: Block Vote
    information:
      - Used in London borough elections and some local district authority elections
      - Used for constituencies where there are multiple representatives elected
      - A modification of first-past-the-post for electing multiple representatives
    description: >
      <p>
        Block vote, also known as plurality-at-large voting or multiple non-transferable
        vote, is a voting system that elects multiple candidates in each constituency.
        It is as simple as first-past-the-post - voters choose one candidate for each
        available seat in their constituency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The similarity to first-past-the-post means that they share many advantages (they
        are both simple to understand and calculate), but also many disadvantages.  In
        fact, many of these disadvantages are exacerbated by the fact that people will
        usually vote for a single party's candidates in all the possible seats.  This
        means that block vote tends to produce even more disproportionate parliaments
        than first-past-the-post.

questions:
  constituency-reps:
    text: Should voters be able to elect constituency representatives?
    explanation: >
      Currently, voters are grouped into small local areas called "constituencies".  Each
      constituency votes for one (or more) representative to be their MP.  Some people
      believe this to be a vital part of democracy, as it allows anyone to speak to their
      local representative at any time.  Other people argue that local representatives
      are outdated in a world where anyone can engage in politics through the internet.

  proportional-makeup:
    text: Should parliament be perfectly representational of national voting makeup?
    explanation: >
      Currently, the voting system does not attempt to make parliament representational,
      which allows one party to win a majority of MPs whilst still having much lower
      proportion of the vote.  This usually means that smaller parties do not have as
      much power as larger parties.  On the other hand, proportional governments tend to
      produce coalitions, which can lead to less decisive governments.

    explanation: >
      There are many different ways for a voter to select the party or candidate they
      wish to win.  Some systems try to make this as simple as possible, and only require
      a single tick.  This is generally cheaper and easier to implement.  Other systems
      allow voters to express a more nuanced opinion, for example by ranking candidates
      in order.

  calculate-simple:
    text: How simple should the election be to calculate?
    explanation: >
      Some voting systems make it simple to work out who won, requiring a single round,
      and not needing any complex calculations.  This keeps elections inexpensive, and
      often allows the winner to be called the next day.  Other systems require more
      complex calculations, or multiple rounds of voting.  This is more expensive, and
      often causes delays in working out the winner.  However, they arguably allow for a
      more accurate calculation of the public opinion.

    text: Should the voting system aim to eliminate coalitions?
    explanation: >
      Coalitions, where no party wins a complete majority, and so multiple parties need
      to work together to act as government, are more likely to appear in some voting
      systems than others.  Criticisms of coalitions include the idea that they are not
      as secure and stable as complete majority governments.  However, some people argue
      that encouraging multiple parties to come together to form a government allows a
      more democratic approach to governing.
